200,"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor",Class,Draft,"The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.","There are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include: private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages business secrets and intellectual property network status and configuration the product's own code or internal state metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include: the product's own users people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates the developer Information exposures can occur in different ways: the code explicitly inserts sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been scrubbed or sanitized a different weakness or mistake indirectly inserts the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program. the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are unintentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place. It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an information exposure, but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:668:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,"::ORDINALITY:Primary:DESCRIPTION:Developers may insert sensitive information that they do not believe, or they might forget to remove the sensitive information after it has been processed::ORDINALITY:Resultant:DESCRIPTION:Separate mistakes or weaknesses could inadvertently make the sensitive information available to an attacker, such as in a detailed error message that can be read by an unauthorized party::",::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Mobile:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","::TERM:Information Disclosure:DESCRIPTION:This term is frequently used in vulnerability advisories to describe a consequence or technical impact, for any vulnerability that has a loss of confidentiality. Often, CWE-200 can be misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, even when the mistake - i.e., the weakness - is not directly related to the mishandling of the information itself, such as an out-of-bounds read that accesses sensitive memory contents; here, the out-of-bounds read is the primary weakness, not the disclosure of the memory. In addition, this phrase is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but it does not refer to any disclosure of security-relevant information.::TERM:Information Leak:DESCRIPTION:This is a frequently used term, however the leak term has multiple uses within security. In some cases it deals with the accidental exposure of information from a different weakness, but in other cases (such as memory leak), this deals with improper tracking of resources, which can lead to exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the leak term.::","::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::","",,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Bytecode Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysis Inter-application Flow Analysis:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::METHOD:Dynamic Analysis with Automated Results Interpretation:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Web Application Scanner Web Services Scanner Database Scanners:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Fuzz Tester Framework-based Fuzzer Automated Monitored Execution Monitored Virtual Environment - run potentially malicious code in sandbox / wrapper / virtual machine, see if it does anything suspicious:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis - Source Code:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Manual Source Code Review (not inspections):EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis - Source Code:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Context-configured Source Code Weakness Analyzer Cost effective for partial coverage: Source code Weakness Analyzer:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Architecture or Design Review:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Formal Methods / Correct-By-Construction Cost effective for partial coverage: Attack Modeling Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Separation of Privilege:DESCRIPTION:Compartmentalize the system to have safe areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn.

250,"Execution with Unnecessary Privileges",Base,Draft,"The product performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level required, which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.","New weaknesses can be exposed because running with extra privileges, such as root or Administrator, can disable the normal security checks being performed by the operating system or surrounding environment. Other pre-existing weaknesses can turn into security vulnerabilities if they occur while operating at raised privileges. Privilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:269:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:657:VIEW ID:1000::,"",::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Mobile:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","","::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::PHASE:Installation::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:If an application has this design problem, then it can be easier for the developer to make implementation-related errors such as CWE-271 (Privilege Dropping / Lowering Errors).

This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic. Attach the monitor to the process and perform a login. Look for library functions and system calls that indicate when privileges are being raised or dropped. Look for accesses of resources that are restricted to normal users.::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Compare binary / bytecode to application permission manifest Cost effective for partial coverage: Bytecode Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysis Binary Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysis:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Binary / Bytecode disassembler - then use manual analysis for vulnerabilities & anomalies:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::METHOD:Dynamic Analysis with Automated Results Interpretation:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Host-based Vulnerability Scanners - Examine configuration for flaws, verifying that audit mechanisms work, ensure host configuration meets certain predefined criteria:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::METHOD:Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Host Application Interface Scanner:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis - Source Code:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Manual Source Code Review (not inspections) Cost effective for partial coverage: Focused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of source:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis - Source Code:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Source code Weakness Analyzer Context-configured Source Code Weakness Analyzer:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Configuration Checker Permission Manifest Analysis:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::METHOD:Architecture or Design Review:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.) Formal Methods / Correct-By-Construction Cost effective for partial coverage: Attack Modeling:EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation:STRATEGY:Environment Hardening:DESCRIPTION:Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76].

319,"Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information",Base,Draft,"The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.","Many communication channels can be sniffed (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data. Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries. When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to sniff the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself.

Private personal information may include a password, phone number, geographic location, personal messages, credit card number, etc. Private information is important to consider whether the person is a user of the product, or part of a data set that is processed by the product. An exposure of private information does not necessarily prevent the product from working properly, and in fact the exposure might be intended by the developer, e.g. as part of data sharing with other organizations. However, the exposure of personal private information can still be undesirable or explicitly prohibited by law or regulation. Some types of private information include: Government identifiers, such as Social Security Numbers Contact information, such as home addresses and telephone numbers Geographic location - where the user is (or was) Employment history Financial data - such as credit card numbers, salary, bank accounts, and debts Pictures, video, or audio Behavioral patterns - such as web surfing history, when certain activities are performed, etc. Relationships (and types of relationships) with others - family, friends, contacts, etc. Communications - e-mail addresses, private messages, text messages, chat logs, etc. Health - medical conditions, insurance status, prescription records Account passwords and other credentials Some of this information may be characterized as PII (Personally Identifiable Information), Protected Health Information (PHI), etc. Categories of private information may overlap or vary based on the intended usage or the policies and practices of a particular industry. Sometimes data that is not labeled as private can have a privacy implication in a different context. For example, student identification numbers are usually not considered private because there is no explicit and publicly-available mapping to an individual student's personal information.

Programmers often trust the operating environment in which a program runs, and therefore believe that it is acceptable store private information on the file system, in the registry, or in other locally-controlled resources.

362,"Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')",Class,Draft,"The product contains a code sequence that can run concurrently with other code, and the code sequence requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence that is operating concurrently.","This can have security implications when the expected synchronization is in security-critical code, such as recording whether a user is authenticated or modifying important state information that should not be influenced by an outsider. A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc. A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related: Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution. Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource. A race condition exists when an interfering code sequence can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity. Programmers may assume that certain code sequences execute too quickly to be affected by an interfering code sequence; when they are not, this violates atomicity. For example, the single x++ statement may appear atomic at the code layer, but it is actually non-atomic at the instruction layer, since it involves a read (the original value of x), followed by a computation (x+1), followed by a write (save the result to x). The interfering code sequence could be trusted or untrusted. A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:691:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,"",::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Sometimes::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Sometimes::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Sometimes::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Mobile:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:ICS/OT:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::","",,"::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Other):NOTE:When a race condition makes it possible to bypass a resource cleanup routine or trigger multiple initialization routines, it may lead to resource exhaustion (CWE-400).::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:IMPACT:DoS: Instability:NOTE:When a race condition allows multiple control flows to access a resource simultaneously, it might lead the product(s) into unexpected states, possibly resulting in a crash.::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Read Files or Directories:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:When a race condition is combined with predictable resource names and loose permissions, it may be possible for an attacker to overwrite or access confidential data (CWE-59).::","::METHOD:Black Box:DESCRIPTION:Black box methods may be able to identify evidence of race conditions via methods such as multiple simultaneous connections, which may cause the software to become instable or crash.

798,"Use of Hard-coded Credentials",Base,Draft,"The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key, which it uses for its own inbound authentication, outbound communication to external components, or encryption of internal data.","Hard-coded credentials typically create a significant hole that allows an attacker to bypass the authentication that has been configured by the product administrator. This hole might be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Even if detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations: Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials. Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place. The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1391:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:287:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:344:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:671:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:PeerOf:CWE ID:257:VIEW ID:1000::,"::ORDINALITY:Primary::",::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Mobile:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:ICS/OT:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Often::,"","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::","",,"::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:If hard-coded passwords are used, it is almost certain that malicious users will gain access to the account in question.::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Read Application Data:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:IMPACT:Other:NOTE:This weakness can lead to the exposure of resources or functionality to unintended actors, possibly providing attackers with sensitive information or even execute arbitrary code.::","::METHOD:Black Box:DESCRIPTION:Credential storage in configuration files is findable using black box methods, but the use of hard-coded credentials for an incoming authentication routine typically involves an account that is not visible outside of the code.:EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated white box techniques have been published for detecting hard-coded credentials for incoming authentication, but there is some expert disagreement regarding their effectiveness and applicability to a broad range of methods.::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:This weakness may be detectable using manual code analysis.

Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.

In Windows environments, the Encrypted File System (EFS) may provide some protection.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:For inbound authentication: Rather than hard-code a default username and password, key, or other authentication credentials for first time logins, utilize a first login mode that requires the user to enter a unique strong password or key.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:If the product must contain hard-coded credentials or they cannot be removed, perform access control checks and limit which entities can access the feature that requires the hard-coded credentials. For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:For inbound authentication using passwords: apply strong one-way hashes to passwords and store those hashes in a configuration file or database with appropriate access control. That way, theft of the file/database still requires the attacker to try to crack the password. When handling an incoming password during authentication, take the hash of the password and compare it to the saved hash. Use randomly assigned salts for each separate hash that is generated. This increases the amount of computation that an attacker needs to conduct a brute-force attack, possibly limiting the effectiveness of the rainbow table method.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:For front-end to back-end connections: Three solutions are possible, although none are complete. The first suggestion involves the use of generated passwords or keys that are changed automatically and must be entered at given time intervals by a system administrator. These passwords will be held in memory and only be valid for the time intervals. Next, the passwords or keys should be limited at the back end to only performing actions valid for the front end, as opposed to having full access. Finally, the messages sent should be tagged and checksummed with time sensitive values so as to prevent replay-style attacks.::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-29953:DESCRIPTION:Condition Monitor firmware has a maintenance interface with hard-coded credentials:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29953::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-29960:DESCRIPTION:Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29960::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-29964:DESCRIPTION:Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29964::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-30997:DESCRIPTION:Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has a maintenance service that uses undocumented, hard-coded credentials:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30997::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-30314:DESCRIPTION:Firmware for a Safety Instrumented System (SIS) has hard-coded credentials for access to boot configuration:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30314::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-30271:DESCRIPTION:Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used in typical deployments:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30271::REFERENCE:CVE-2021-37555:DESCRIPTION:Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-37555::REFERENCE:CVE-2021-35033:DESCRIPTION:Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-35033::REFERENCE:CVE-2012-3503:DESCRIPTION:Installation script has a hard-coded secret token value, allowing attackers to bypass authentication:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-3503::REFERENCE:CVE-2010-2772:DESCRIPTION:SCADA system uses a hard-coded password to protect back-end database containing authorization information, exploited by Stuxnet worm:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2772::REFERENCE:CVE-2010-2073:DESCRIPTION:FTP server library uses hard-coded usernames and passwords for three default accounts:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2073::REFERENCE:CVE-2010-1573:DESCRIPTION:Chain: Router firmware uses hard-coded username and password for access to debug functionality, which can be used to execute arbitrary code:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1573::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-2369:DESCRIPTION:Server uses hard-coded authentication key:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2369::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-0961:DESCRIPTION:Backup product uses hard-coded username and password, allowing attackers to bypass authentication via the RPC interface:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0961::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-1160:DESCRIPTION:Security appliance uses hard-coded password allowing attackers to gain root access:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1160::REFERENCE:CVE-2006-7142:DESCRIPTION:Drive encryption product stores hard-coded cryptographic keys for encrypted configuration files in executable programs:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-7142::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-3716:DESCRIPTION:VoIP product uses hard-coded public credentials that cannot be changed, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-3716::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-3803:DESCRIPTION:VoIP product uses hard coded public and private SNMP community strings that cannot be changed, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-3803::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-0496:DESCRIPTION:Backup product contains hard-coded credentials that effectively serve as a back door, which allows remote attackers to access the file system:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-0496::",,,"::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:MSC03-J:ENTRY NAME:Never hard code sensitive information::TAXONOMY NAME:OMG ASCSM:ENTRY ID:ASCSM-CWE-798::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 3-3:ENTRY NAME:Req SR 1.5::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 4-2:ENTRY NAME:Req CR 1.5::",::191::70::,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions.

927,"Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication",Variant,Incomplete,"The Android application uses an implicit intent for transmitting sensitive data to other applications.","Since an implicit intent does not specify a particular application to receive the data, any application can process the intent by using an Intent Filter for that intent. This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data. There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky. Ordered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain. Sticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents. In addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific URI included in the intent. A malicious receiver that intercepts this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource at the specified URI.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:285:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:668:VIEW ID:1000::,"",::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Mobile:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design::","",,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:Other applications, possibly untrusted, can read the data that is offered through the Intent.::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Varies by Context:NOTE:The application may handle responses from untrusted applications on the device, which could cause it to perform unexpected or unauthorized actions.::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.

941,"Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel",Base,Incomplete,"The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.","Attackers at the destination may be able to spoof trusted servers to steal data or cause a denial of service. There are at least two distinct weaknesses that can cause the product to communicate with an unintended destination: If the product allows an attacker to control which destination is specified, then the attacker can cause it to connect to an untrusted or malicious destination. For example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions. If the product incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. For example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android application may use a sticky broadcast to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:923:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:406:VIEW ID:1000::,"",::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Mobile:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::","",,"","","","::REFERENCE:CVE-2013-5211:DESCRIPTION:composite: NTP feature generates large responses (high amplification factor) with spoofed UDP source addresses.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-5211::REFERENCE:CVE-1999-0513:DESCRIPTION:Classic Smurf attack, using spoofed ICMP packets to broadcast addresses.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-0513::REFERENCE:CVE-1999-1379:DESCRIPTION:DNS query with spoofed source address causes more traffic to be returned to spoofed address than was sent by the attacker.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1379::",,,"",,"",
