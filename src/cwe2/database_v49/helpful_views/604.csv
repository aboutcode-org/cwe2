71,"DEPRECATED: Apple '.DS_Store'",Variant,Deprecated,"This entry has been deprecated as it represents a specific observed example of a UNIX Hard Link weakness type rather than its own individual weakness type. Please refer to CWE-62.","",,"",,"","","","",,"","","","",,,"",,"",
92,"DEPRECATED: Improper Sanitization of Custom Special Characters",Base,Deprecated,"This entry has been deprecated. It originally came from PLOVER, which sometimes defined other and miscellaneous categories in order to satisfy exhaustiveness requirements for taxonomies. Within the context of CWE, the use of a more abstract entry is preferred in mapping situations. CWE-75 is a more appropriate mapping.","",,"",,"","","","",,"","","","",,,"",,"",
132,"DEPRECATED: Miscalculated Null Termination",Base,Deprecated,"This entry has been deprecated because it was a duplicate of CWE-170. All content has been transferred to CWE-170.","",,"",,"","","","",,"","","","",,,"",,"",
216,"DEPRECATED: Containment Errors (Container Errors)",Class,Deprecated,"This entry has been deprecated, as it was not effective as a weakness and was structured more like a category. In addition, the name is inappropriate, since the container term is widely understood by developers in different ways than originally intended by PLOVER, the original source for this entry.","",,"",,"","","","",,"","","","",,,"",,"",
217,"DEPRECATED: Failure to Protect Stored Data from Modification",Base,Deprecated,"This entry has been deprecated because it incorporated and confused multiple weaknesses. The issues formerly covered in this entry can be found at CWE-766 and CWE-767.","",,"",,"","","","",,"","","","",,,"",,"",
218,"DEPRECATED: Failure to provide confidentiality for stored data",Base,Deprecated,"This weakness has been deprecated because it was a duplicate of CWE-493. All content has been transferred to CWE-493.","",,"",,"","","","",,"","","","",,,"",,"",

249,"DEPRECATED: Often Misused: Path Manipulation",Variant,Deprecated,"This entry has been deprecated because of name confusion and an accidental combination of multiple weaknesses. Most of its content has been transferred to CWE-785.","This entry was deprecated for several reasons. The primary reason is over-loading of the path manipulation term and the description. The original description for this entry was the same as that for the Often Misused: File System item in the original Seven Pernicious Kingdoms paper. However, Seven Pernicious Kingdoms also has a Path Manipulation phrase that is for external control of pathnames (CWE-73), which is a factor in symbolic link following and path traversal, neither of which is explicitly mentioned in 7PK. Fortify uses the phrase Often Misused: Path Manipulation for a broader range of problems, generally for issues related to buffer management. Given the multiple conflicting uses of this term, there is a chance that CWE users may have incorrectly mapped to this entry. The second reason for deprecation is an implied combination of multiple weaknesses within buffer-handling functions. The focus of this entry was generally on the path-conversion functions and their association with buffer overflows. However, some of Fortify's Vulncat entries have the term path manipulation but describe a non-overflow weakness in which the buffer is not guaranteed to contain the entire pathname, i.e., there is information truncation (see CWE-222 for a similar concept). A new entry for this non-overflow weakness may be created in a future version of CWE.",,"",,"","","","",,"","","","",,,"",,"",

365,"DEPRECATED: Race Condition in Switch",Base,Deprecated,"This entry has been deprecated. There are no documented cases in which a switch's control expression is evaluated more than once.","It is likely that this entry was initially created based on a misinterpretation of the original source material. The original source intended to explain how switches could be unpredictable when using threads, if the control expressions used data or variables that could change between execution of different threads. That weakness is already covered by CWE-367. Despite the ambiguity in the documentation for some languages and compilers, in practice, they all evaluate the switch control expression only once. If future languages state that the code explicitly evaluates the control expression more than once, then this would not be a weakness, but the language performing as designed.",,"",,"","","","",,"","","","",,,"",,"",
373,"DEPRECATED: State Synchronization Error",Base,Deprecated,"This entry was deprecated because it overlapped the same concepts as race condition (CWE-362) and Improper Synchronization (CWE-662).","",,"",,"","","","",,"","","","",,,"",,"",

596,"DEPRECATED: Incorrect Semantic Object Comparison",Base,Deprecated,"This weakness has been deprecated. It was poorly described and difficult to distinguish from other entries.
